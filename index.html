        <h2>What is Sensible?</h2>

<p>Sensible makes it easy to design responsive, mobile-first websites. It is a collection of SCSS mixins designed to make mobile-first design easier.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Requires SASS.
Compass + Sassy Math required for sens-variable-sizing.</p>

<h2>What is sens-variable-sizing?</h2>

<p>It's experimental.</p>

<p>It automatically increases the base font-size in ems as the viewport widens. It follows the growth path provided by y=(cuberootx)/3, where y=font-size and x=viewport width.</p>

<p>I'll explain what that means better at a later date.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Read the source right now, its not that long, and pretty self explanatory.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:sensible@nathancrank.com">sensible@nathancrank.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>Bleeding edge only. That said, if you design using the principles of progressive enhancement, then this supports every browser ever.</p>
