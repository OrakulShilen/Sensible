# Sensible v0.1
A Mobile-First Responsive Design SCSS framework
Nathan Crank

## What is Sensible?
Sensible makes it easy to design responsive, mobile-first websites. It is a collection of SCSS mixins designed to make mobile-first design easier.

## Requirements
Requires SASS.
Compass + Sassy Math required for sens-variable-sizing.

## What is sens-variable-sizing?
It's experimental.

It automatically increases the base font-size in ems as the viewport widens. It follows the growth path provided by y=(cuberootx)/z, where y=font-size and x=viewport width and z is the user provided divisor (defaults to 3).

I'll explain what that means better at a later date.

## Documentation
Read the source right now, its not that long, and pretty self explanatory.

## Support
You can email me at sensible@nathancrank.com if you have questions.

## Browser Support
Bleeding edge only. That said, if you design using the principles of progressive enhancement, then this supports every browser ever.
