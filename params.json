It is a collection of SCSS mixins designed to make mobile-first design easier.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nRequires SASS.\r\nCompass + Sassy Math required for sens-variable-sizing.\r\n\r\n## What is sens-variable-sizing?\r\nIt's experimental.\r\n\r\nIt automatically increases the base font-size in ems as the viewport widens. It follows the growth path provided by y=(cuberootx)/3, where y=font-size and x=viewport width.\r\n\r\nI'll explain what that means better at a later date.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nRead the source right now, its not that long, and pretty self explanatory.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nYou can email me at sensible@nathancrank.com if you have questions.\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\nBleeding edge only. That said, if you design using the principles of progressive enhancement, then this supports every browser ever.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nNew BSD License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Nathan Crank\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n    * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the\r\n      names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\r\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
